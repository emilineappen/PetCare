Project: PetCare Web App (Beginner / Demo Only)

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This application is ONLY for demo and academic purposes.
- I do NOT want real authentication.
- I do NOT want cloud, database, or backend authentication.
- The login system must be DUMMY / FAKE.

APP TYPE:
- Simple web application
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript only
- No frameworks unless absolutely necessary

USER TYPE:
- Pet Owner only

AUTHENTICATION (DUMMY ONLY):
1. Create a Login Page
   - Fields: Username or Email, Password
   - Login button
   - NO validation of credentials
   - Clicking Login should ALWAYS succeed
   - On login, store a dummy user object in localStorage
     Example: { "name": "Pet Owner", "loggedIn": true }
   - Redirect to Home page immediately

2. Optional Register Page (Dummy)
   - Fields: Name, Email
   - Register button
   - No real storage
   - Redirect to Login page

3. Session Handling:
   - Use localStorage ONLY
   - If dummy user exists → user is logged in
   - If not → redirect to Login page
   - Logout button clears localStorage

APP PAGES (ALL REQUIRE DUMMY LOGIN):
1. Home Page
   - Title: "WELCOME TO PETBUDDY"
   - Navigation links:
     - Shopping
     - AI Veterinarian
     - Book Consultation
     - Pet Profile
     - Logout

2. Shopping Page
   - Static list of pet products
   - Add to cart button (UI only, no payment)

3. AI Veterinarian Page
   - Simple chat-style UI
   - Predefined responses (no real AI)

4. Book Consultation Page
   - Select vet name
   - Select date
   - Select time
   - Confirm booking
   - Store booking in localStorage

5. Pet Profile Page
   - Fields:
     - Pet name
     - Breed
     - Age
     - Medical history
   - Save and display data using localStorage

ACCESS CONTROL:
- If user is not logged in (no dummy user in localStorage), redirect to Login page
- Do NOT allow access to any page without login

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Very simple and clean UI
- Beginner-friendly layout
- No complex animations
- Add comments in code explaining each section

DO NOT:
- Do NOT implement real authentication
- Do NOT use Firebase or any cloud service
- Do NOT use payment gateways
- Do NOT overengineer

GOAL:
Create a complete beginner-friendly PetCare app with a dummy login interface that looks real but works purely for demonstration.
