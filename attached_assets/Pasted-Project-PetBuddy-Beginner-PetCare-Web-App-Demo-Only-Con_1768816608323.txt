Project: PetBuddy – Beginner PetCare Web App (Demo Only)

Context:
- This is an academic, beginner-level demo project.
- The app already exists with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Authentication is DUMMY using localStorage only.
- No cloud, no database, no real backend authentication.
- Do NOT refactor into frameworks or advanced patterns.

TASK:
Improve and complete the existing application with the following changes and additions while keeping everything simple.

--------------------------------
1. Currency Change
--------------------------------
- Change all product prices from dollars ($) to Indian Rupees (₹).
- Example: $10 → ₹799 (use realistic INR values).
- Update currency symbol everywhere (Shopping page, Cart, summaries).

--------------------------------
2. Shopping Page Enhancements
--------------------------------
- Add more static pet products (total 8–10 items).
- Example products:
  - Dog Food
  - Cat Food
  - Pet Shampoo
  - Dog Leash
  - Pet Toys
  - Pet Bed
  - Cat Litter
- Each product should show:
  - Product name
  - Price in ₹
  - “Add to Cart” button (UI only, no payment logic)

--------------------------------
3. Consultation Confirmation Alert
--------------------------------
- When a user books a consultation:
  - Show a clear alert message like:
    “Consultation booked successfully with Dr. <Doctor Name>”
- This alert must appear on the frontend immediately after booking.
- Store consultation details in localStorage.

--------------------------------
4. Multiple Pet Profiles Support
--------------------------------
- Modify the Pet Profile feature to support MULTIPLE pets per user.
- Reason: One household may have more than one pet.
- Requirements:
  - Allow adding multiple pets.
  - Each pet should have:
    - Pet Name
    - Breed
    - Age
    - Medical History
  - Display pets as a list or cards.
  - Save all pet profiles in localStorage as an array.
  - Allow viewing all saved pets on the Pet Profile page.

--------------------------------
5. Maintain Dummy Login Rules
--------------------------------
- Keep login system dummy.
- No credential validation.
- Use localStorage only.
- Redirect unauthenticated users to Login page.

--------------------------------
6. UI & Code Rules
--------------------------------
- Keep UI clean and beginner-friendly.
- Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
- Add comments explaining logic clearly.
- Do NOT introduce Firebase, APIs, payment gateways, or AI services.
- Do NOT overcomplicate the code.

--------------------------------
GOAL:
Enhance the existing PetBuddy demo app to feel more complete and realistic for presentation, while still being simple, offline, and beginner-friendly.
